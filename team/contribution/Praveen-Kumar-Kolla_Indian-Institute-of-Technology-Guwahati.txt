Elites

I have done the literature review on the research paper "Evaluting the wisdom of crowds".The name of that paper in github folder is "wagner_2010". I have done the task of "Brainstorming new ideas" and I have also completed the task of rating those new ideas.I have done two tasks namely "Predicting the distance between cities" and "Number of retweets of a specific person" which were used to conduct the experiment.I have proposed a research question "How does the size of crowd affect itâ€™s wisdom?", summarized the literature on that question, proposed an experiment to test it and described how to analyze the data from that experiment. I have contributed in verifying and updating the "checker file" in google spread sheets. I have also contributed in discussing about the domain name of our website. I have tested the beta version of the web platform and suggested improvements in tricider.com. I have learnt "R" programming language very well in the process of doing this project.
