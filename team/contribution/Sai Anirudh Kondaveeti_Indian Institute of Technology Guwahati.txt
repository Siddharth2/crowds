Looked after overall coordination of team relating to team meetings ,assignment submissions, work distribution. Reviewed "Learning from the Wisdom of Crowds by Minimax Entropy" during literature survey which was an aggregation methodology. Did the brainstorming with team about the new tasks and then rated them. I have done two tasks namely "Predicting the distance between cities" and "Number of retweets of a specific person", of which I was mainly involved in "Predicting the distance between cities" like deciding the corpus, making the resources for the task, the questions and gave suggestions for the other task. Saw that the tasks are submitted in the right format and then checked the other teams file which were assigned to my team. Then proposed the research question "How does the size of crowd affect itâ€™s wisdom?" and was involved in the design and analysis of the task. Then gave my suggestions on improvements of website after testing the beta version of the site.Participated in the domain name choosing process. Also learned "R" by doing the assignemnts.
