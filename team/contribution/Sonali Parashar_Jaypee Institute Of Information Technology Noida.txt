Being a part of the team I had a responsibility of assisting other members of the team with the work. I initially worked on the task "Historical monuments of the world" and collected the varied data required for the same i.e, pictures of monuments and their respective locations. A presentation on same was given by myself in the 4th week on Google hangouts. Also, during the checker file task I was given the responsibility to make sure that all the images were consistent in size. During the last days, I supported other team members with the coding in R.
