Team: Blitz

Studied the paper "The wisdom of ignorant crowds: Predicting sport outcomes by mere recognition" and did more literature review along with my other team members. Designed the task on "Celebrity Ages" and scraped the data for the same. Also designed the tasks on "Celebrity Ages", and "US Elections" along with my team. Our team was selected amongst the top 2 teams for this assignment. Gave a presentation on hangouts for the task on "Celebrity Ages". Along with my team members, proposed a research question "What should be the size of the crowd for a Wisdom of Crowds Experiment?", did literature review and designed a task for the same. Performed analysis on the given data set using ggplot, dplyr libraries, in R. As the team leader, helped in managing most of the activities.
