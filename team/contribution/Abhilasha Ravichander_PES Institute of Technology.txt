Completed the required reading for the project to gain a better understanding. Attended the weekly lectures. During the initial phase, brainstormed to come up with different ideas where the wisdom of crowds would be interesting to observe and carried out a literature survey by identifying and reviewing relevant papers. Rated the domains generated by the group. Involved in creating the descriptions, defining the corpus as well as suggesting the appopriate sampling procedure for each domain.Wrote data analysis scripts in R. Also proposed a research question, summarised the literature on the question,  proposed an experiment to test it and described how to analyse the data from that experiment. Aside from these activities, I also reviewed and gave relevant and specific critiques for my peers submissions on crowdgrader.
