Looked for existing scholarly articles on 'Wisdom of crowds'. Helped with the team weekly tasks and kept looking for ideas that showcase the wisdom or madness of a crowd. Was involved in the "Country Landmass" task and helped the team with other tasks. Over the course of time, learnt data analytics and R. Also made sure that I read and understood every submission on crowdgrader by other teams.
