Team Segment


I studied past literature on data 
science which was very helpful in 
giving an insight into the vast field.
The team also worked on creating the 
best possible universal set of
Q&A's for the assigned question.
During the process we extracted 
the data by scraping and applied 
the parameters to obtain the 
required degree of randomness.
