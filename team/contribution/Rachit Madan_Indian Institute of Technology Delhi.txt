Team: Blitz

Studied the paper "The wisdom of ignorant crowds: Predicting sport outcomes by mere recognition" and did more literature review along with other members of my team. Designed the task on "Celebrity Ages" and collected data for the same. Also helped other members in designing the task "US Elections". Our team was selected amongst the top 2 teams for this assignment. Gave a presentation on hangouts for the task on "Celebrity Ages". Along with my team members, proposed the research question "What should be the size of the crowd for a Wisdom of Crowds Experiment?", did extensive literature review and designed a task for the same. Performed analysis on the given data set using ggplot, dplyr libraries and submitted the assignments. Contributed to data generation for the Wisdom of Crowds experiment by attempting the tasks on the website. Regularly peer graded other assignments. Checked the 2 requirements assigned to our team on the checker sheet, and pointed out the changes to some of the teams that they needed to make. As the team leader, helped in managing most of the activities and coordinating with other team members.
