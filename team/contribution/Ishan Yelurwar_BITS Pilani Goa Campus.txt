At the start of this project searched for existing literature on Wisdom of Crowds and summarized the papers "What are the effects of crowd size and diversity on crowd performance?" by Daniel Romero and "Harnessing the Wisdom of Crowds: Video Event Detection based on Synchronous Comments" by Xingtian Shi. Also read the literature posted by everyone else. Brainstormed possible tasks that could be used for the testing of Wisdom of Crowds. Peer graded assignments and suggested improvements for the tasks. Actively participated in all the meetings. Designed the "Amazon Price" task which was selected among the top tasks and presented the same on Hangouts. Worked on the "Country Population" task along with my team. In the latter stages proposed a research question "To identify intelligent sub crowds from larger crowds and to compare their performance with the crowds as whole." along with an experiment to test the same. Also submitted the R assignments and a basic data analysis using R for the sample data given.
