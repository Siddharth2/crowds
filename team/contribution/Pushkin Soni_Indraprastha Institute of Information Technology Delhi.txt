Black Hat Hackers

With the start of this project, i have done literature review by submitting paper on crowd sourcing and wisdom of crowds while reading and thinking about literature on crowds.On this ongoing project, in a team we had made questions based on our tasks.We had made our peers review.Then came R programming assignment.The researchers had given us many help in this project via mail and hangout meeting which i had attended all. A useful experience for me.
