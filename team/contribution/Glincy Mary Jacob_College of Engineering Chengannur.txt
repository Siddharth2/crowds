Performed literature survey and summarized the paper, "Crowdsourcing urban air temperatures from smartphone battery?temperatures",A.Overeem,J.C.R.Robinson,H. Lejinse,G.J.Steenveld,B.K.P.Horn,R. Uijlenhoet,Geophysical Research Letters,2013,vol.40. Identified and summarized the paper, Brown AW, Allison DB, "Using Crowdsourcing to Evaluate Published Scientific Literature: Methods and Example.",PLoS ONE 9(7): e100647. Also rated the ideas for new tasks. Cooperated in the making of the description and the method of generating the answers. Created the 20 question for the domains allocated. Designed the task brands_popularity. Also opted for an extra task and made the design for the task construction_years. Went through the feedbacks and made the necessary changes. Cooperated with team in developing the research question,"Does the Wisdom of crowd effect gets decreased when crowd consist of someone who is very popular".Proposed an experiment to test the research question and developed the description to analyze the data. Reviewed the checker file and marked the errors in unpolished tasks. Tested the beta version of the webpage and posted ideas and voted on ideas that seemed to be needed. Performed the R homework of flipping of the coin. Also did the homework R script to analyze data.  Proposed the research question, "If we estimate the crowd with those users who had high confidence when answering the question, does the crowd estimate improve?". Performed thorough analysis and found that as the confidence increases the absolute mean error decreases. Came to a conclusion that if the confidence is high then the answer tends to be correct and the confidence level is a suitable measure for the correct evaluation of results. Apart from the above, attended most of the weekly meetings, gave weekly feedbacks and reviewed the assignments in crowdgrader.
