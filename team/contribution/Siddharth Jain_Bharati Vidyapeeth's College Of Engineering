Lakshya Team
I read the papers and articles intially and gave the overview of the topic to the team. I peer reviewed the articles submitted by the other members. I had submitted few examples of situations on which wisdom of crowds can be implemmented. On the topic "SAT score" I had created a corpus on verbal section of the exam with twenty multiple choice questions.
