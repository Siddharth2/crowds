During the program my initial activities included reading literature on crowdsourcing and wisdom of crowds and I submitted some papers for literature review ,my team also proposed a layout for the web design of the experiment then as the project progressed my team submitted photos and related questions for tasks assigned to us and meanwhile we also did review other teams submissions also after this I learnt and participated a bit in R programming activity(not indulged much during last few weeks) , during the entire duration of project I attended meetings held on google hangouts (guest lectures as well as main meetings) and being the  team leader I also effectively managed my team .
