I had a very active role in my team. In my team initially I took up one paper and did the literary research on that and also did brainstorming of ideas for the tasks. In following weeks, I worked initially on the task "Identify the city of Historical building" with another team mate, and did the report for the domain and also contributed some to other tasks of my team. A few weeks later, when our team got an additional task to do("Number of Years to Create A Famous Building"), I took it up and was resonsible for doing all the work on it. I was also responsible of creating the documents of our submissions and amalgamating our work into one report. Further in the checker file task, I was responsible for one column assigned to me and did checking for the same. In the data analysis task, I was one of the coders and did initial tasks given and later implemented some of the functions for crowd ranking as well as for our research question.
