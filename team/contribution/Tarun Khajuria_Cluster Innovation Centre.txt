During the program i was the team leader for my team, so the primary responsibility that i had held was to attend or watch the meeting video understand the task and divide the work amongst the team. The first task that i completed was to go through the literature available reated to wisdom of crowds and had submitted the summary for relevant papers. The other work done was on proposing a research question along with a relevant task to experiemnt. I had designed and submitted an experiment using user's profession to divide them into valid categories of crowd to check for improvement of accuracy by selecting more expert crowd. When we had to create the task content for the website, had helped both the other members arranging data for their task and understanding the validity of the data for the task. Finaly read a lot more literature on the problem during the course espcially while designing the experiments. The last task i performed was data analytics task towards the end of project for us.
