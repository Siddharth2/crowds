I have performed the literature review on the research paper “Prediction Markets and the Financial “Wisdom of Crowds” and I have also uploaded the paper in github with the name “Ray2006”. I also came up with 2 ideas as a part of assignment 1. I have performed the task of “Brainstorming new ideas” and I have also reviewed the ideas of the other teams and have also rated them accordingly and have mentioned if any improvements could be made for assignment 2. For assignment 3, our team was allotted with two topics namely “Number of retweets of a specific person” and “Predicting the distance between cities” based on our preferences. I worked on coming up with the domain we will be working on for the questions to be posed to the crowd. I have also worked on coming up with a very convenient corpus related to our tasks. I have also worked on gathering all the relevant material required for the questions(gathering images etc.) and came up with 20 questions for each task. I have also contributed for coming up with a domain name of our website. I have got a hands on experience with “R” as a byproduct of this project.
