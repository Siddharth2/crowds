As a team leader of my team, my primary responsibility was to co-ordinate with the team and manage the activities and submissions. As a team member, I was responsible for doing the literary research on one paper and brainstorming different ideas for the tasks for the first week, then in next weeks, took up the task "Guess the Flag", and did the report for the domain and was also responsible in finetuning my team member's tasks. I also gave a presentation of this task in Google Hangouts during Week 4. All the github and crowdgrader submissions and communications with mentors were done by me on behalf of my team. Further during the checker file task, I took up one of the columns we were assigned and checked and tallied with other teams, mailing them for correct information. Finally, during the last phase I was the main coder in R for my team and with their equal contributions did data analysis task and implemented the research question in R code(one of the best take-aways I had from this experience!).
