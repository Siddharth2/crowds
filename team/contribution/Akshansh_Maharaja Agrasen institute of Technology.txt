Searched through the internet for existing papers on "Wisdom of crowd”, read papers submitted by others. In later stages proposed a research topic "Searching smartness within the crowd" and also designed the experiment for the same. Involved designing of the task "International Holidays" and also helped the team through the other 3 tasks.
