Began the project work with by exploring research papers on various applications of Wisdom of Crowd. Summarised the paper 

'The “Wisdom of the Crowd Pattern”: A Person-centric data aggregation approach for Social Software' by Peter Lachenmaier 

and Florian Ott. Also analysed the literature posted by my peers and peer graded assignments on Piazza. Brainstormed 

possible tasks that could be used for the testing of Wisdom of Crowds.  Actively participated in all the meetings.I was 

involved in checking the 2 tasks 'amazon_price' and 'country_population'. In the latter stages proposed a research 

question "To identify intelligent sub crowds from larger crowds and to compare their performance with the crowds as 

whole." and summarised the research paper "The Wisdom of Smaller, Smarter Crowds." by Daniel G. Goldstein,R. Preston 

McAfee and Siddharth Suri.
