Body	Sorry for the tardy reply - got filtered to the wrong place...
	 I am using gam in mgcv (1.3-22) and trying to use gcv to help with model
	 selection.  However, I'm a little confused by the process of assessing GCV
	 scores based on their magnitude (or on relative changes in magnitude).
	 Differences in GCV scores often seem ""obvious"" with my poisson gams but
	 with negative binomial, the decision seems less clear.
