TASK: Weight of an Object

DESCRIPTION: We will show you a series of questions wherein you’ll be presented with an image and name of an everyday object. You must enter what you feel could be the true weight of the object shown (decimal precision permitted). Kindly take note of the unit of measurement, which would be explicitly mentioned for every question. For reference: 1 kilogram (kg) ≈ 2.2 pounds (lbs), 1 kilogram (kg) = 1000 grams (g)

CORPUS: The website "randomthings" was used to generate a list of random collection of everyday objects. 20 objects were selected from this list, subject to their suitability to the problem of weight estimation.

For finding weights of objects, since most objects were consumer goods, e-commerce websites were used to find the weights and images of the objects:
	http://www.amazon.com/
	http://www.flipkart.com/

METHODOLOGY: The objects were chosen from the randomly generated list. Their true images and exact weights were taken from e-commerce websites like amazon and flipkart. To give an idea of size representation wherever required, such as for the TV, soft toy, and container, length/volume estimates were also mentioned alongside the name of the object. Also, for lighter objects the weight was asked in grams, while for the heavier ones the weight was asked in kilograms, for a more appropriate analysis.
