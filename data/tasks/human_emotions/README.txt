TASK: Guessing the emotion of a person

DESCRIPTION: We will provide you with a picture of a person expressing a certain emotion. We will also provide you with 5 options, one of which is the correct emotion being expressed. The other 4 would be incorrect options. We would like you to select that option from the given set of options, which you feel is the correct emotion being expressed by the person in the picture.

INPUT TYPE: A picture showing a person expressing a particular emotion.

CORPUS: 

The corpus of the task is available at 
http://www.kasrl.org/jaffe.html

This corpus is known as Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) Database and contains clear and sharp images of human faces depicting 6 basic human emotions which are Angry, Distress, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Fear. However as observed by the creators of this corpus, there is some evidence in the scientific literature that fear may be processed differently from the other basic facial expressions and that most expressors are not good at posing fear thus that expression has been excluded for this experiment. Therefore we have chosen to show the first 5 basic emotions i.e. Angry, Distress, Happy, Sad, and Surprise.


METHODOLOGY:       

The corpus had several expressors whose faces were captured. From these we randomly chose 4 expressors. For each of these 4 expressors we selected 1 picture each showing the 5 different expressions. It may be noted that each expressor had 3 pictures for each of the 5 emotions, of which we picked 1 for each emotion. Therefore we now have a representative data set of 20 images, 5 each for every emotion.


ANSWERS: 

Multiple Choice - The participant is given 5 different option with different emotions. The participant has to choose the option which he/she thinks is the correct emotion of the expressor shown in the picture for the question.


Multiple choice Option Selection - We first choose 1 option to be the correct emotion depicted by an expressor in the picture. The other 4 options will be the remaining 4 emotions which are incorrect for that particular picture. For all questions, since the 5 options will remain the same, the order of options appearing to the user need not be randomized for every question as it might unnecessarily confuse the user who if the order of the same 5 options are randomized in every question.
