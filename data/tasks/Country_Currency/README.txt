	You will be given a series of multiple choice questions. For each question you will be shown a picture of a nation’s currency and asked to identify the nation to which the currency belongs to.

Input type: 
	Image of the country’s currency note. For validity of the experiment, we have blurred parts of the image of the currency note that has the country’s name written on it

Corpus:

Representative Tasks Methodology: 
	A random sample of 20 countries chosen using a one dimensional weighted sampling technique, with the dimension being the population of a country. 
We kept in mind that most countries belonging to the European Union have Euro as their currency, and hence avoided sampling those countries.
