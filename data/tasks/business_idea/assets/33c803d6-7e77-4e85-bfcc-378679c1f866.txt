Earin - The Worlds Smallest Wireless Earbuds
Wireless earbuds filled with sound, yet so small they are almost invisible!
With the power of the AptX solution for digital audio Earin can secure an audio transfer that is optimised for instant real-time audio streaming. Earin is the smallest, wireless earbuds available on the market. Two earbuds that together function as one Bluetooth headphone; no cables, no attachments just magically small delivering high quality audio sound. Our compact capsule design is perfect for storing your earbuds and will also easily fit in your pocket whatever youâ€™re wearing. For us it was extremely important to make Earin magically small in size and light weight.
