Food AND fuel....from the same land!
A multi-product facility producing advanced bio fuels, gluten free flour, and non-forestry building products, using sweet sorghum.
The two most important co-products are gluten free flour, and OSB/LSB lumber. Once that juice is removed, the remaining mass can then be run through a flour mill, creating a high fiber, gluten free flour. A bonus by-product of the fuel cell is heat- a lot of it. The Comfith contains the sugar-bearing juice that is fermented to create ethanol. Have you priced gluten free foods?
