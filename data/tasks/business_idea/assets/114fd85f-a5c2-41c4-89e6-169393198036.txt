iStick™: USB Flash Drive with Lightning for iPhone and iPad
iStick™: The World's first USB flash drive with integrated Apple Lightning connector. Made for iPhone & iPad.
We all have used a USB flash drive at least once in our lives. The USB flash drive is great but it doesn't work with your favorite Apple iDevices. Just slide the switch on the iStick to switch the USB connector to an Apple approved Lightning connector.

iStick turns from an ordinary USB flash drive to a flash drive that is Apple MFi certified to work with iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Prototype A: How nice would it be to be able to simply connect a USB flash drive into the iPhone or iPad to transfer data without going through iTunes, the computer or the Internet? It was basically sticking a 30-pin connector (the original iPhone/iPad connector) at the other end of a USB stick.
