Ineffably
Free social app designed as a tool for everyone seeking recreational activity fun! Users will be able to stay connected with friends.
I began looking for vendors and water fountains and couldn't find one. i didn't know if i was in NYC or in the dessert. I started searching for bike shops around my location using google maps on my iPhone 5s. Google maps suggested the nearest open bike shop was located around canal street. As the adventurist that i am, i decided to walk the distance towards the bike shop. Instead of just looking for water fountains and bike shops i thought it would be great to make an APP where users can find all water fountains, bike shops, baseball, football, soccer fields, basketball and tennis courts around their area.
