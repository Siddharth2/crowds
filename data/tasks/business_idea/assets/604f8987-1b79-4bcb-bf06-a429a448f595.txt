CNC Plasma cutter table help us to help others
Trying to create a small job CNC plasma welding shop, your funds will buy you time on the cnc.
My name is Brian Gunter I own MN powdercoat and I want to expand into cnc plasma cutting, but I need the funds to buy a good table and plasma cutter. And it can become a reality with your help, Every dollar you give to this starter will actually be a credit for labor or set up time on the cnc plasma cutter, materials will be charged at cost. In the spirit of kickstarter this project is about you and you dreams as well as my dream. 

But what you will receive in return for your donation will be what you dream up, your prototype, or even your product. What I hope to do is create a user friendly plasma cutting service, one where the customer (you) can really talk to the person doing the work, the one that runs the machine,

This plan has worked just fine for powdercoating, I see no reason it wont work for Plasma cutting.
