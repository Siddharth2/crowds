New computer/Recording setup for expanding YouTube Channel.
Looking for anyone to throw in even a few dollars towards helping me add variety and increased video quality (voice-overs, live camera)


Expansion PCI Slots (Available/Total) 1x PCI-e 16x ( No available ) 1x PCI-e 1x ( available ) 1x PCI ( available ) I don't really have a whole lot to give in terms of rewards because I don't really have much. My YouTube channel ChainedActivation has been rolling at a slow start and this is mostly due to the lack of variety I can provide. Simply making Yu-Gi-Oh gameplay videos with no voice over due to lack of microphone, no live face camera for picture in picture or for other gameplays takes away from making your channel memorable. While I don't plan on being a PewDiePie or Markiplier or so on Â in terms of popularity I want to be able to provide people with streams, gameplays, reviews, and random rants.
