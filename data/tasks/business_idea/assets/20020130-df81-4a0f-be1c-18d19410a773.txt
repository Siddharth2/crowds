World’s first roast-grind-brew coffee machine
Raw green coffee beans to fresh black coffee - at a single push of a button. Let's change coffee. Together.
We have worked over 2 years to make our vision become reality by developing, enhancing and testing our roast-grind-brew coffee machine. Our roast-grind-brew coffee machine enables you to roast green beans on their own and therefore enables farmers to directly sell their green, raw coffee beans to you. With the world's first roast-grind-brew coffee machine we can disrupt the value chain, empower farmers and bring you the fairest and freshest coffee experience right into your own home. 

The following views will give you an overview of how the technical components will be arranged within your machine. Help us show the world that it is time to change the way coffee is perceived, traded and enjoyed.
