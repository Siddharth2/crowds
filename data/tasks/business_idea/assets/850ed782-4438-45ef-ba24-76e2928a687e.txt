Neptune Pine: Smartwatch. Reinvented.
Neptune Pine, the definitive all-in-one smartwatch. Voice calls, video chat, full keyboard, GPS & much more.
Thatâ€™s why we decided to develop our own smartwatch: the Neptune Pine, the most connected independent smartwatch. That's why the Neptune Pine runs on the world's most advanced mobile OS: Android Jelly Bean. With up to 32GB of storage, the Pine easily stores thousands of songs, on your wrist. Since our screen resolution is a standard resolution listed in the Android SDK, the Pine will seamlessly run hundreds of thousands of existing apps. Here we go with the most compelling list of features for a smartwatch you'll ever see.
