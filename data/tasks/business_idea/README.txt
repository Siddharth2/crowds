TASK: Success of a Business Idea

DESCRIPTION. You will be presented with a description of a Business Idea. You have to assess whether it will be successful or not. 

CORPUS: A list of Kickstarter’s business ideas is prepared with funded projects tagged as successful, and non-funded projects as not successful. The corpus is built using following two parameters: Deadline, and Funding Status. Total permutations then determine the inclusion in Corpus:
	1. The deadline for funding has been passed, and is non funded: Include in the Corpus as Unsuccessful.
	2. The deadline for funding has not been reached, and is not funded yet: Do not include in corpus.
	3. The deadline for funding has not been reached, and project is funded: Include in the Corpus as Successful.
	4. The deadline for funding has been passed, and is funded: Include in the Corpus as Successful.

	We are writing a spider that will create the corpus as well as create the “tsv” file for us.
		
METHODOLOGY: 
	TASKS
	20 Samples are selected randomly from the Corpus.
	
	ANSWERS
	For each task, the participant answers whether they think it is going to be a success or not, answered in form of “Yes”, or “No”,
