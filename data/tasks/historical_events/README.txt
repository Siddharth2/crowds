TASK: Guess the order of historical events 


DESCRIPTION: We will provide you with a list of five events that have occurred in history. We will also provide you with 4 options which contain the sorted set of the five entries. However only one of the four options is sorted chronologically. We would like you to select that option from the given set of options, which you feel is the chronologically sorted order of the given list, as the correct one.

INPUT TYPE: List of five events that have occurred in history.

CORPUS: The corpus for this task is available at  the webpage             (http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/09/100-events-in-twentieth-century-world-history-berkeley-undergraduates-really-should-now.html). This webpage contains a list of top 50 historical events that occurred in the last century. We have restricted ourselves to only the last century so that many events may likely to be known by the general population.


METHODOLOGY:       

There are 100 events in the list and 20 completely different (mutually exclusive) lists can be generated. A random sample of 20 questions with a list of 5 events each was chosen from the corpus.



ANSWERS: 

Multiple Choice - The participant is given 4 different option with differently ordered events, the participant has to choose the option which he/she thinks is the chronologically sorted option.


Multiple choice Option Selection - 1 of the options is the correct answer with the list sorted in chronological order. The other 3 options are chosen from random combinations of the numbers 1,2,3,4 and 5.
