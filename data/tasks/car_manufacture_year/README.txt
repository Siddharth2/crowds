https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=ford%20car%20models

METHODOLOGY: 

TASKS
20 cars are randomly chosen from the list with at least one car from each year.

ANSWERS

For each task, the four wrong answers were selected by random sampling in a range of 15 years in order to avoid completely impossible answer choices. Also we have sampled years and chosen cars to get a uniformly distributed representative sample.
