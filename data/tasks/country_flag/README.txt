TASK: Identify The Flag Of The Country 

SHORT DESCRIPTION: “We will be showing you a series of 20 Flags of Different Countries. With each flag, you will be given a choice of 5 probable country names to which the flag may belong to. You have to choose the right country name!” 

INPUT TYPE: The input to these questions would be an IMAGE of a national flag  

CORPUS:For selecting the flags, we would first gather the list of top 20 countries from this link: http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/populations/ctypopls.htm 
Next, the flags for the respective countries can be downloaded from:
http://flagpedia.net/download
We selected these corpus, because it provided an all-complete list of countries and provided options for sorting based on any criteria.

METHODOLOGY:
TASKS
As guessing the flags is one of the difficult task for the crowd, we just considered top 20 largest countries in our questionare. Based on personal testing between us(as we ourselves represent 'the crowd'!), we found this was the best way to sample out data, ahead of GDP, population and even random sampling. We were able to guess more countries when we were presented top 20 countries based on area, than when we were presented top countries based on population or GDP, or even when we did random sampling from a set of 40 top countries based on area. Moreover, the bigger countries like China are more known than the smaller countries like Malta, and so are their flags. So without much tricking the crowd, this is the best option!

MULTIPLE CHOICE OPTIONS:
For the incorrect options we have selected names of about 80 countries which are at the top in the list of area. And from those countries we randomly chose 4 of them for each task, which means we randomly chose answers from the most popular ones, making them unrepeated as well as unbiased(as suggested in feedback at CrowdGrader as well as by the professor). This way we could ensure a firm methodology for uniqueness as well as randomness of choices provided to the crowd. Random options were selected through self-made script
