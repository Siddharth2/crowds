However, I'm a little confused by the process of assessing GCV > scores based on their magnitude (or on relative changes in magnitude). > > Differences in GCV scores often seem "obvious" with my poisson gams but > with negative binomial, the decision seems less clear. - This is not well  documented - sorry. The negative binomial is a special case for mgcv::gam (see ?gam.neg.bin). To handle the extra parameter of the negative binomial, smoothing parameter estimation *has* to be performed via `performance iteration' (see ?gam.method), which is not the default for any other family. Within the IRLS loop of the performance iteration an extra step is inserted which estimates the negative binomial parameter at each iteration, in order to try and achieve a scale parameter estimate of 1 (see ?gam.neg.bin). However, trying to force the estimated scale parameter to 1 will also force the GCV score used in performance iteration to be close to 1 (at least for large samples), whatever model is fitted.... so comparison of GCV scores between different neg.bin models is unlikely to be very informative. In addition small changes in GCV score are not meaningful when comparing different models fitted by performance iteration, for any family (again see details section of ?gam.method). I think that AIC() would provide a better basis for comparing alternative neg.bin GAMs: it's even more approximate than usual when used in this context, since the neg.bin parameter estimate is definitely not an MLE, but it will still give a much more meaningful guide than comparison of GCV scores, in this case.  For other families none of these problems occur provided the default direct (`outer') smoothness selection method is used. 	No answers	NA

On 4/27/07, Somu <som.ctc@gmail.com> wrote:> Please give me one simple example using glob..

But suppose i am in dir D:/Scripts/Test and i> want to open another file E:/Games/readme.txt how do i do it?> open(FH, "<", 'E:\Games\readme.txt'); You've asked four separate questions here: one on paths, one onglobbing, one on finding files, and one pipes. You should probablysplit them up into four threads, but here goes: If you had really read the glob perldoc, you would have seen that itpoints you to File::Glob where everything is expalined and there areat least six examples.  Briefly, then, globbing is a way of generatinglists of files that match certain criteria. It deliberately imitatesthe behavior of popular unix shells. Something like     my @files = <*.doc>; will find all the files in the current directory with filenames endingin ".doc". To use it with open, you'd put it in a loop, e.g.:     while (<*.doc>) {        open(FH, ">", $_) or die "$!\n";        # do something        close FH;    } This makes it convenient to work with multiple files that match aparticular patter, but it doesn't change the fact that to open a file,you have to know where it is. since only you know your filesystem andwhere your files might be stored, you have to provide a valid relativeor absolute path. If you don't know where the file is, you need tofind it somehow. File::Find would be a good place to start. Pipes are something else entirely. A pipe lets you pass output fromfrom one program to another. opening a pipe for reading will let youread the output of another program into your perl program. Opening apipe for writing will pass whatever you write to the filehandle to anexternal program. So something like     open(FH, ">", "| /WINDOWS/System32/notepad.exe") or die "$!\n"; Would send anythig you print to FH on along to notepad. But sincenotepad doesn't, I think, read from STDIN, it probably won't doanything useful. You'll probably need to use Win32::OLE or some otherWindows API to pass your data to notepad.

So somehow you have managed to install prada without an essential dependency 'rrcov'.  That looks like a problem in the Debian/Ubuntu packaging of prada.  (There is a list R-sig-debian for such issues.)  Running install.packages("rrcov") inside R should fix this for you: if your R is not current (i.e. < 2.5.0) you may need to run R as root for that session.  (There may be a Debian package for rrcov for your OS and R version, but without further details I cannot check.)  In the current version of prada (1.12.0 for BioC-2.0 for R 2.5.0) rrcov is in Imports, so probably your version of BioC is not current either.  [...]  --  Brian D.
