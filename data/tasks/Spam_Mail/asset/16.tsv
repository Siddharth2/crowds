Subject	Re: [R] Need Help with robustbase package: fitnorm2 and plotnorm2
Body	That is not the case: rrcov is a separate package, and one prada depends on.  So somehow you have managed to install prada without an essential dependency 'rrcov'.  That looks like a problem in the Debian/Ubuntu packaging of prada.  (There is a list R-sig-debian for such issues.)Running install.packages(""rrcov"") inside R should fix this for you: if your R is not current (i.e. < 2.5.0) you may need to run R as root for that session.  (There may be a Debian package for rrcov for your OS and R version, but without further details I cannot check.)In the current version of prada (1.12.0 for BioC-2.0 for R 2.5.0) rrcov is in Imports, so probably your version of BioC is not current either.--  Brian D.
