TASK: Predicting the mood/emotion of a person, given the image.

DESCRIPTION:We will ask you a series of 20 multiple-choice questions. 
	    For each question, we will show you an image of a person 
	    exhibiting a particular mood/emotion. You will have to identify 
	    the emotion shown by the person in the image by choosing 1
	    answer out of the 5 options given to you.

CORPUS: For the list of all human emotions, we used the following link: 
	http://www.imagesource.com/categories/feelings-and-emotions.
	This lists a total of 16 human emotions.We divided this list 
	into 3 sub lists-Positive, negative and neutral categories. 
	For Example, list Positive will consist of emotions like happiness,
	List Neutral will consist of emotions like confidence, ambition etc.
	Corresponding to each emotion, we will obtain a total of 3 images
	(depicting that emotion) from the same site as above. The images will be
	chosen randomly, for each emotion. So, our universe will consist of 80
	images in total, depicting all the human emotions. 
	

METHODOLOGY:

	TASKS:
	 Sample 20 images from the universe randomly.
	
	ANSWERS:
	Each question will have a set of 5 options for the answer.
	One of the options will always be “Can’t say”, in case the participant is
	unable to predict the emotion shown in the image. For the 3 options
	(other than the correct answer) we have seen which of the 3 lists
	(positive, negative or neutral) the answer belongs to, and selected the other
	options from that list plus the neutral list. In this way, we have made sure
	that none of the options can easily be rejected (for example, the option
	“happy” can easily be rejected for an image showing a girl who is
	showing an expression of agony).
