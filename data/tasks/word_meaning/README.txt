We would like you to select that option from the given set of options, which you feel is the most accurate meaning of the given list, as the correct one.

Perfect if you want to impress the examiner in examinations like: IELTS, TOEFL and Cambridge CAE and CPE.

Thus comprehensively this page contains the top 100 words (and the example sentences) the crowd should know.

METHODOLOGY:     
A random selection selection of 20 sentences from the corpus is made out of the total 100. It is the easiest implementable method.

Another methodology could involve selecting 10 alphabets in random. For each selected alphabet, two sentences can be randomly selected thus giving 20 questions as required.

The meaning of the word is found on www.thesaurus.com. One synonym is picked as the correct answer. Four more words are chosen at random. Their synonyms are found. This redirection can happen multiple number of times. Finally 4 incorrect options can be chosen which can be close to the result.
