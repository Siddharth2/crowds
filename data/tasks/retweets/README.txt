Representative Tasks methodology: 

We select the randomly the 20 people and their tweets as the questions. So there is randomness in the questions. For people who don’t have much idea on retweets we are also providing the number of his followers so that they can make an educated guess depending on the content of tweet rather than pure guessing. Our team felt this as the right amount of information which can be given to the participant. This is neither excess or meager for a participant to guess. It will be interesting to see when the ‘No of followers’ information is not provided to participant.
