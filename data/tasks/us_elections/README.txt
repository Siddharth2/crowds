TASK: Given a state in the USA, predict whether residents will predominantly vote for the Republican party, or the Democratic party, in the 2016 presidential elections.

DESCRIPTION: We will now ask you a series of questions. For each question we will give you the name of a city in the US and ask you to predict whether the residents of that state will predominantly vote for the Republican party, or the Democratic party.

CORPUS: We will use the following Wikipedia link which classifies each state into the red or blue category.
		Red: States carried by the Republican in all four elections (2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012)
		Blue: States carried by the Democrat in all four elections (2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012)
		There are other categories also, like states carried by the Democrat in three of the four elections. But, we will not be considering these states while sampling. 
		So, basically, if the state is a blue state, then the answer would be the Democratic Party, and if the state is a red state, the answer would be the Republican Party.
