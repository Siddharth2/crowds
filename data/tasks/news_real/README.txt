                                         SAMPLE QUESTION
Question: Predict whether the news is real or not: “India beat Ireland to register 9th straight world cup win”.                                                                                                                                Description: Same as above.                                                                                                                  No. of Channels: 15.                                                                                                                         Correct Answer: 1(TRUE).                                                                                                                            On what basis I have chosen right answer: Here since the number of channels showing the news are in a large number. So one might think that the news is right but also one can also think that India can’t be beaten up by Ireland in WC (here it is what the human intuition is coming into the play).  If we check the records most time India beaten up the Ireland. Therefore I have selected 1 i.e., true.
