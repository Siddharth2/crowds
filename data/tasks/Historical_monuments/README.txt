TASK: Identify  the country to which the Historical Monument/Landmark belongs to.

SHORT DESCRIPTION: You go through the series of  multiple choice questions, each consists of an image of one of the famous landmarks of the world and will require you to identify the country which it belongs to.  

INPUT TYPE: Image

CORPUS: The images for the top 100 famous landmarks were extracted from the site:
	http://designlike.com/2011/12/05/100-most-famous-landmarks-around-the-world/
	
	The tourism rankings for the sampling were retreived from:
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourism_rankings

METHODOLOGY:
TASKS
We will sample 20 questions out of a Dataset by:
1.First selecting all the 100 most famous landmarks(including historical monuments) from the corpus

2.Final Dataset will be created by sorting the above countries according to their Tourism Rate provided by the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourism_rankings
In the above mentioned corpus, we chose the top 10 visited countries first and and also we had a reference to the separate tables given at the same page which hold the tourism rates of countries grouped by the regions they belong to i.e., Africa, middle-east,Europe,America etc, taking 2 from each list. Now from this extended set of countries, we sampled out 20 containing famous landmarks. 
We selected this methodology as we need to select that dataset of historical monuments which are most visited and hence hold more chance of being popular amongst the crowd we would be experimenting upon. Moreover, including region specific tourism rates from separate tables made it even more varied(so that our quiz does not confine to a specific region like Europe itself!). Finally, when we conducted the wisdom of crowd experiment on ourselves, we could identify about half of the monuments and their Countries suggesting that this is the appropriate way to sample questions(as we ourselves represent the crowd!).

MULTIPLE CHOICE OPTIONS:
For the incorrect options we have selected names of about top 40 countries which are at the top in the list of tourism rates(from both combined world wide list and region specific lists). And from those countries we randomly chose 4 of them for each task, which means we randomly chose answers from the most popular ones. This way we could ensure a firm methodology for uniqueness as well as randomness of choices provided to the crowd, and there is no bias given to top countries as well(as suggested by Professor to us).
