					SAMPLE QUESTION
Question: Identify the correct number of twitter follower of “Shakira”.
Description: Same as above.
Options:
	a. 1500
	b. 29,540,000
	c. 17,600
	d. 42,580,000
	e. 35,960,158
Correct answer: b
On what basis I have chosen wrong answer: In 5 choices, I thought that I should give some least values of followers that must be excluded easily from the choices. So a and c options will be neglected. The remaining options are on the basis of tweets given. Option d has large no of tweets than correct option c. And it’s true that more the tweets more will be the followers. Option e is more appropriable answer, as it is near about c option.
