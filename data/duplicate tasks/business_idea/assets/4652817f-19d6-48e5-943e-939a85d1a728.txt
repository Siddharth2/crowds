NudeAudio Super-M
Super-high performance Bluetooth speaker; waterproof & sand proof, that fits in your jeans pocket - minus all the stuff you don't need.
And in true Nude style, The Standard's Limited Edition Super-M is in the buff, colored monotone nude. Peter Riering-Czekalla, Chief Design Officer,Â  is the creative lead of NudeAudio and is looking after all elements of design and brand experience. We are very excited to announce a new Special Edition Super-M collaboration with UK star-DJ, MistaJam. He also agreed to hand paint 20 sets of grilles of Super-M to create a David Shillinglaw Limited Edition especially for Kickstarter backers. Many of you asked for it so we added a Kickstarter edition.
